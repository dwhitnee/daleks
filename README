About
----
The Daleks video game, written entirely in HTML5 and javascript.

No canvas, just HTML elements and CSS.  Each image is an HTML div with the background-image style set.  The pieces are animated using javascript to update the css position of each div.  Actons are handled by JQuery events bindings to other div elements.

All code written and directed by David Whitney.
Images stolen liberally from the web.

jQuery is used for DOM manipulation and event handling.
Google Closure Compiler for compilation and compression.

Gameplay inspired by the 1984 Mac version by Johan Strandberg, but it is much like the other "robots" type games as seen here on Wikipedia
